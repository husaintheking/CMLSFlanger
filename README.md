<img src="img/pedals.jpg" alt="flanger" width="200"/>

## **Overview**

This project is a flanger effect plugin using the JUCE platform. The flanger is implemented using a delay line connected to an LFO and an interpolation algorithm. The effect plugin has various tone-shaping controls such as feedback, LFO frequency, width, delay time and depth. It also has controls for the LFO waveform type and can function in either mono or stereo. This plugin can be used as a VST within any DAW to modify and add effects to the sound of an instrument or a recording. 


## **Tone Controls**
- Feedback: the amount of delay feedback to be added to the signal 
- Feedback polarity: positive or negative
- LFO Frequency: the frequency of the LFO
- LFO Waveform type: sine, triangle, sawtooth rising and sawtooth falling
- LFO Width: the amplitude of the LFO waveform
- Delay: minimum delay time in the delay line
- Depth: the amount of flanging effect added with the signal
